#This will be a practice project using what I have learned with React Native. These images may NOT be used for other purposes than this practice site alone, as they are owned and copyrighted by a live website. With their permission, I will take some of what is on that website and create a practice mobile application. This will NOT have any backend functionality and will not function as an actual usable app. This is testing frontend only to further my skills and showcase my learnings.
